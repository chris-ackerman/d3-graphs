# d3-graphs
This is my repository for graphs I made in d3.js

I reformatted this code from a graph I found online to make it useful for us, so there might be stuff left over that doesn't
make sense

• the .css and .html file are for styling
• the .js file is where the magic happens.


•Files - My .css and .html files are for content and styling, nothing new there. My .js file is where I manipulate the data to be useful and cool. My .json file is the data, formatted in a way that I believe would be easy to duplicate with a callback function from the MySQL database.
